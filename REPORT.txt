AI-Powered YouTube Content Moderation: Approach & Methodology
Introduction
With the vast amount of user-generated content on YouTube, ensuring a safe and engaging online environment is crucial. This project focuses on scraping, cleaning, analyzing, and moderating YouTube video metadata and comments to identify spam, toxicity, and sentiment trends.

Methodology
Web Scraping

Utilized YouTubeâ€™s API or web scraping techniques to extract video titles, descriptions, comments, likes, and other metadata.
Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Spam & Toxic Comment Detection

Applied keyword-based filtering for initial spam detection. Future enhancements include ML-based classification.
Data Visualization

Generated word clouds, bar charts, and sentiment distribution graphs to uncover insights from the dataset.
Conclusion & Future Scope
This project lays the foundation for AI-driven content moderation. Future work includes advanced ML-based spam detection, real-time moderation dashboards, and model fine-tuning for better accuracy.
